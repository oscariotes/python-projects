    "\n",
    "    Select a Word: Choose a word that players will try to guess.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Display Initial Information: Display information to the player (like the number of letters in the word or dashes representing each letter).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Game Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "    Display Current State: Show the current state of the word (underscores for unguessed letters and revealed letters for guessed ones).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Take User Input: Ask the player to guess a letter.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Check Guess: Validate if the guess is valid (a single letter) and if it's present in the word.\n",
    "        If the letter is correct:\n",
    "            Reveal the letter in the word.\n",
    "            Update the displayed word.\n",
    "            \n",
    "        If the letter is incorrect:\n",
    "            Decrease the remaining attempts (if you have a limit on guesses).\n",
    "    Check Win/Lose Conditions: Check if the player has won by guessing all letters or if they've used all their attempts. End the game accordingly.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Repeat Steps 1-4 until Game Ends: Keep looping until the game ends (either by winning or losing).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: End of Game\n",
    "\n",
    "    Display Results: Show the player whether they won or lost.\n",
    "    Ask to Play Again: Ask if the player wants to play again. If yes, restart the game; if no, end the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Word Selection: Initially, you can manually select a word. Later, you might create a word bank or use APIs to fetch random words.\n",
    "    Graphics for Hangman: You might consider creating a visual representation of the hangman's gallows and updating it with each incorrect guess.\n",
    "    Error Handling: Validate user input (e.g., check if it's a single letter) and handle invalid inputs gracefully.\n",
    "    Keep Track of Progress: Track the guessed letters, remaining attempts, and the state of the word to help the player and manage the game flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps provide a general outline. As you start coding, you'll dive deeper into implementing the logic and functionalities for each step to create a functional hangman game."
