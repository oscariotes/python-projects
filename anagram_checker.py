""" Exercise: Anagram Checker

    Objective: Write a Python function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other.
    Steps:
        Create a function is_anagram(str1, str2) that takes two strings as arguments.
        Check if the two strings contain the same characters in any order (anagrams).
        Return True if they are anagrams and False otherwise.
        Ensure the function handles input strings of different lengths and different characters.
    Hints for Implementation:
        Convert both strings to lowercase to ignore case sensitivity.
        Remove spaces and punctuation marks from the strings for accurate comparison.
        Sort the characters of both strings (after normalization) and compare the sorted strings.
        Handle special cases where the strings are of different lengths or contain different characters. """
